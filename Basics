Time–Frequency Analysis of Non-Stationary Signals using STFT and Wavelet Transform

1. Introduction
Signal Processing deals with the analysis, modification, and interpretation of signals. A signal is any physical quantity that varies with time, space, or another independent variable. Examples include audio signals, ECG signals, vibration signals, and communication signals.

This project focuses on analyzing non-stationary signals using advanced time–frequency techniques.

2. Stationary vs Non-Stationary Signals
A stationary signal has frequency content that does not change with time. A non-stationary signal has frequency components that vary over time.

Most real-world signals are non-stationary, which makes classical Fourier analysis insufficient.

3. Fourier Transform (FT)
The Fourier Transform converts a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation. However, it provides no information about when a particular frequency occurs.

Mathematically:
X(f) = ∫ x(t) e^(-j2πft) dt

This assumption of stationarity limits its usefulness for real-world signals.

4. Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
STFT solves the time-localization problem by applying the Fourier Transform over short, sliding windows.

STFT equation:
STFT(t,f) = ∫ x(τ) w(τ−t) e^(-j2πfτ) dτ

STFT introduces a tradeoff between time and frequency resolution due to fixed window size.

5. Time–Frequency Resolution Tradeoff
A short window gives good time resolution but poor frequency resolution.
A long window gives good frequency resolution but poor time resolution.

This limitation is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

6. Wavelet Transform
The Wavelet Transform uses variable-sized windows.
High-frequency components use short windows, while low-frequency components use long windows.

This property is known as multi-resolution analysis.

7. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)
CWT analyzes signals at different scales using a mother wavelet.

CWT equation:
CWT(a,b) = ∫ x(t) ψ*((t−b)/a) dt

Wavelets provide better transient detection compared to STFT.

8. Comparison: STFT vs Wavelet Transform
STFT uses fixed resolution and struggles with signals containing both fast and slow variations.
Wavelets adapt resolution automatically and are better suited for non-stationary signals.

9. MATLAB Implementation Overview
The project is implemented in MATLAB using built-in functions such as fft, spectrogram, and cwt.
Signals are generated synthetically to clearly demonstrate theoretical concepts.
